# -Digit-Classification-Using-PCA-and-LDA-Techniques
Hello! My name is Khaled Ashraf, and I have developed this project to participate in Kaggle's Handwritten Digit Recognition Competition using machine learning and pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this project is to build an efficient and accurate model that can classify digital images of handwritten digits into their corresponding numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

This competition is based on a well-known dataset called the MNIST dataset. It contains images of handwritten digits, where each image is represented by gray-scale pixels with values ranging from 0 to 255. The goal of the model is to accurately identify the correct digit for each image by analyzing the patterns present in the images.

In this project, we used various Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and model development. We also utilized unsupervised learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance, along with supervised learning like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for building the classification model.

Summary of the Steps Followed in This Project: Loading and Processing Data: Loading and processing the data to clean and prepare it for modeling. Splitting the Data: Dividing the data into training and testing sets with an 80% training and 20% testing ratio. Normalizing the Data: Normalizing the image data to have values between 0 and 1 to improve model performance. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Using PCA to reduce dimensionality to 200 principal components to decrease complexity and enhance model efficiency. Training with LDA: Training the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model on the training data. Evaluation and Testing: Evaluating the model using the test set and calculating accuracy with a confusion matrix.
